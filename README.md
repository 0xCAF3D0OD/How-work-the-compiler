# How-work-the-compiler

## Introduction
Do you know how the compiler works, no?! Neither do I, so I made this article to understand how it really works.

## CPU
* the processor(`CPU` or Central Processing Unit) is the logic circuity that respond to basic instructions that make the computer running. `The brain of the computer`

* at a low level, computer processor can only do a small number of things.
  1. they can read and write to memory.
  2. they can do math with number they are holding.

## Executable Program
* Is generated by the compiler is a list of instruction
