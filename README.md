# How-work-the-compiler

## Introduction
Do you know how the compiler works, no?! Neither do I, so I made this article to understand how it really works.

## CPU
* the processor(`CPU` or Central Processing Unit) is the logic circuity that respond to basic instructions that make the computer running. **The brain of the computer**

* at a low level, computer processor can only do a small number of things.
  1. they can read and write to memory.
  2. they can do math with number they are holding.

## Executable Program
* Is generated by the compiler is a list of instructions for the processor to follow, the are written in binary. this instruction are called **machine code**

* When we talk about programming we talk about high level programming with condition, loop, etc..., all that is for make the work easier for the humans to understand it and this is called **source code**.
* that is called source code.
